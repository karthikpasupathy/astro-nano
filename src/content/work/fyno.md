My second zero to one journey. Fyno is on a mission to revolutionize the CCM space and I work with an amazing bunch of people to make sure they're seen for the true value they offer. I do pretty much everything under the marketing umbrella - designing collaterals, writing emails, doing copywriting, managing events - you name it. It's intense, chaotic, but it's a ton of learning. I'm enjoying it so far.
