The dystopian future we read about in science fiction novels is already here. It just doesn't look like what we imagined.
Yes, there are no robots walking the streets or flying cars zooming over our heads. Not yet. 

But we have something that is equally unsettling – a world where we can't simply exist without performing for an audience.
When was the last time you saw someone truly enjoy a concert? People watch live performances through their camera apps, ready to capture 'the right moment'. The music, the atmosphere, the collective joy of being as one and enjoying the music is gone. Every moment comes filtered through a smartphone display.

Travel isn't about discovery anymore. It's about content. People hop between Insta-worthy locations, trying to capture the perfect shot. They go looking for restaurants to post pictures of the amazing looking food they had. The joy of getting lost in a new city without an agenda, is almost extinct. 

And you can't just create art anymore. You can't just write a book, run a magazine, write poetry, make art. You also need to be a "content creator." You need to hit a critical mass of followers to even get a publisher to notice you.

Every business owner must be an influencer. You can't rest until you've "cracked" it, because you have to grab the attention of your potential customers. “You have to get above the noise” as they say it. 

You're not truly independent. You're always under pressure to create and perform. You can't be burnt out or take a break, because the algorithm wants you to post every day. Take a break, and you become invisible. The future of your business depends on engagement metrics, follower counts, and likes.

We've turned against each other too. We fight viciously over trivial things online. We've formed digital tribes, ready to attack anyone who questions our beliefs, our idols, or our choices.

We're uncertain about our kids' future. With AI coming into the picture and taking entry-level jobs, we have to question the very existence of schools, colleges, and careers.

Isn’t this dystopian enough?

We didn't need an authoritarian regime to control us. We built our own little bubble. And the scariest part? We're all willing participants. We have the key to break free. But we won't use it. Because somewhere along the way, our cage became our comfort zone.
