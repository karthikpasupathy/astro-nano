It was just another ordinary day in November 2018 when an extraordinary realization struck me: my time as a technical writer was running out.

At the time, I was a senior technical writer at Freshworks with over four years of experience in the SaaS space. I was making good money for someone who had started their career at 25, and I had just returned from my first solo international trip. Life was good.

But then a nagging question crept into my mind: “Where do I see myself in 5 years? And 10 years?”

I didn’t have an answer.

After some research, I discovered that the career path of a technical writer typically ends at Technical Writing Lead. There is no “Head of Technical Writing,” “VP of Technical Writing,” or “Chief Tech Writing Officer.”

Moreover, I was already making 90% of the highest salary for a technical writing role in India. I was one step away from hitting the ceiling in my career.

This scenario felt all too familiar. It reminded me of my previous stint as an academic author, a little-known job that involves creating assessment questions for schools and colleges in the US. After eleven months in that role, I knew I needed to switch careers before it was too late.

Now, faced with a similar situation, I decided to explore alternative paths for my career.

### Finding my next stop

I started talking to various leaders and fellow technical writers inside and outside the company to understand my options. I also listened to podcasts, read articles, and scoured the internet for stories of people who had transitioned from technical writing to other roles.

In a conversation with my manager, he suggested two potential paths: becoming a product manager or a product marketer. A friend also mentioned the possibility of becoming a technical program manager.

These suggestions made sense, as I was already working closely with the engineering, design, and product management teams to write product documentation.

To decide which path to pursue, I did a simple three-step exercise:

* I listed the roles and responsibilities for each position
* I listed my skills and capabilities
* I jotted down my current responsibilities

Then, I applied a simple formula: if I combined my current responsibilities, skills, and capabilities, which role would be the best fit?

The answer was product marketing. It had similarities to technical writing, indicating an easier transition. It also offered a promising growth path for at least the next 10 years, with the ultimate prize being a VP of Marketing or a CMO.

### I got a product marketing role because I asked for it

Right when I decided to become a product marketer, an internal job opened up on my team. A product marketer had been moved to another project, and they were looking for candidates to fill the role.

I knew this was my chance. I had another technical writer working with me at the time, so I went to my boss and said, “Hey! I know you're looking for a product marketer. I know what a product marketer does, and I already have a good relationship with the product team. If you give me a chance, I could become a product marketer.”

To my surprise, the answer was yes. I worked as a product marketer on a trial basis for three months, and then I was officially given the role.

Sometimes, to get an opportunity, all you have to do is ask.

### Always foresee the future of your career

Regardless of your current stage or designation, make a habit of foreseeing the future of your career every 2–3 years.

With rapid changes in technology, the economy, and politics, understanding how these factors will impact your career is crucial. By spotting potential hurdles, you can adapt and upskill accordingly, and make sure that your professional growth remains on track.

Don't wait until your career hits a dead end before exploring new paths. Take a moment to ask yourself: where do you see yourself in 5 years? And 10 years?

The answer might surprise you.
